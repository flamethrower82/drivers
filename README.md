Working on getting wonky hardware working on Linux. Not an expert, feel free to fork!

So far I was able to track down the vendors and IDs for:

Logitech/Saitek Flight Instrument Panel

Logitech/Saitek Flight Radio Panel

Logitech/Saitek Flight Multi-Panel

Logitech/Saitek Flight Switch Panel

* You'll need to put the udev rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/10-logitech.rules before you can do anything else!!!!
Still working on the rest...
