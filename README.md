# drivers
Working on getting wonky hardware working on Linux. Not an expert, feel free to fork!

So far I was able to track down the vendors and IDs for:

Logitech/Saitek Flight Instrument Panel

Logitech/Saitek Flight Radio Panel

Logitech/Saitek Flight Multi-Panel

Logitech/Saitek Flight Switch Panel

This is a project in the works. So far only evdev detects it as a joystick, but no dice on the js driver.
